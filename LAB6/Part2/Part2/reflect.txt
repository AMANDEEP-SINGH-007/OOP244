This workshop was quite a haste for me. I did not get much time to work on this workshop(thanks to my poor time management and other projects). Still, I tried my best to learn as much as I can.
So, in this workshop I learnt about various functions such as peek, fail, get, getline and setstate, and used them. However, I am still unsure about the working of get and getline, and would try to learn them properly, when I get sufficient time.

As usual, the 1st part was plain road. Since everything was provided in detailed explanation. So, with little bit of notes reading and readme.md. I was able to complete the 1st part.

However, the 2nd part was a headache because I did not have much time to complete it. As a result, there were errors in my code, and the output coming was wrong. But Mitchell Rose  helped me in correcting my read function, and I completed my 2nd part as well.
